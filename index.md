## The RSE Association of Australia and New Zealand

This community aims to build awareness of the diverse Research Software 
Engineer (RSE) roles, to connect volunteers in the RSE domain, and to 
help build practical solutions for the [RSE community](/about). 

This community is for:

## Meetups

RSE-AUNZ currently hosts regular meetups in some areas. Currently, we have coordinators for Canberra, Brisbane, Parkville in Melbourne and Monash in Melbourne.

You can fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/2SHLQ5JvTokfW2rp8) to express your interest in a local meetup or volunteer to be a coordinator. _Coordinator roles take about 2 hours a month, 1 hour for choosing a regular date/time/location to meet and emailing reminders to the mailing list, and 1 hour for going to the meetup itself_.


## About the RSE movement 

The [Society of Research Software Engineering](https://society-rse.org/), 
originally coined the term "Research Software Engineer",
says the following about RSEs: 
> “A growing number of people in academia combine expertise in 
> programming with an intricate understanding of research. 
> Although this combination of skills is extremely valuable, 
> these people lack a formal place in the academic system.”
> [(link)](https://www.cemac.leeds.ac.uk/events/research-software-engineers/).

Inspired by the success of the RSE Association in UK, we 
established the RSE Australia and New Zealand Association in 2017. 
Together with  international bodies and support from our national 
organisations such as AeRO, New Zealand eScience Infrastructure ([NeSI](https://www.nesi.org.nz/)), the Australian Research Data Commons 
([ARDC](https://ardc.edu.au/resource-hub/?_categories=research-software)), and research institutions, we aim to campaign for the 
recognition and wider adoption of the RSE role within the research 
ecosystem. 
We also want to advocate for appropriate recognition, reward and career opportunities
for RSEs. 
We plan to organise regular [events](https://rse-aunz.github.io/events/) to allow RSEs to meet, exchange 
knowledge and collaborate on methods to create these opportunities.

We conducted an initial "Expression of Interest" survey in 2017 among Australian and 
New Zealand researchers and found that a majority of the respondents 
 prioritised:
1. Increased recognition of the RSE role, 
1. More appropriate, consistent and representative position descriptions 
and KPIs, and 
1. Community development through regular events and gatherings. 

Please join us to actively work on growing this community and 
advocating for others. 
Together, we can build a sustainable community that benefits research 
software engineers, and ultimately contributes to more efficient and 
reproducible research.

## Code of Conduct
We are committed to creating a welcoming and supportive environment for all of our members.
All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.
This is why we have a [Code of Conduct](https://rse-aunz.github.io/code-of-conduct).
