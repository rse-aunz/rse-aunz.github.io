Collaborative Conference on Computational and Data Intensive Science (C3DIS) 2019 is on from the 6th to the 10th of May. We are asking for members of the RSE community to volunteer to help us run a Hacky Hour in the evening of Wednesday the 8th May and to also extend an invitation to the Friday all day RSE workshop.

This is the [link to the Hacky Hour page for C3DIS](http://www.c3dis.com/3295).

Because the main percentage of C3DIS delegates are researchers,  we have decided to do a Hacky Hour to give back to the community. The idea is to promote Hacky Hours generally, connect volunteer RSEs or research support people who want to help, and to get some cross domain problems written down.

We then want to feed those cross domain problems into the Friday workshop to identify some solutions that we could convert into proposals to send to funders like the ARDC, NCI, Pawsey, and BPA. This is a great opportunity as these funders have just been provided funding and are already thinking of how they might allocate these funds.

If you are going to C3DIS and would like to help or be part of the Hacky Hour, [please register here.](https://cdesign.eventsair.com/2019-c3dis/hacky-hour/Site/Register)
