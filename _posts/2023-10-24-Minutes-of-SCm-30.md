## Attending

## Update fiscal sponsorship [MS]

    * [Dispute resolution document](https://hackmd.io/@manodeep/rse-aunz-dispute-resolution)
    * [Succession plan](https://hackmd.io/@manodeep/rse-aunz-succession-plan)

## New business
* Suggestion by RM: We should keep new business to a minimum, given that we only have three out of the five members attending. Focusing on operational and new members might be useful.

### New committee members 
* MS to ask contact NeSI.


### Newsletter
- [Recurring item] Setup the monthly email template in advance so that it can be approved in the meeting so it can be sent out as part of the meeting - kind of like a co-working session. Standing item of the committee should be to approve the email for this month. This was agreed by MS, JB, RM.

### Meeting minutes
- [New] Standing item of the committe should be to approve a draft minutes to put on the website. This was agreed by MS, JB, RM.
- [New] Minimise what is put into the minutes, focus on actions and chasing-up while still making it useful for the community. This was agreed by MS, JB, RM.

### Approval procedure for SC matters
- [New] Discuss that when we have non-financial, non-strategic, operational changes that need to be approved and partial approval from members of 50%, we seek approval from the rest of the committee by email. If there is no response within 3 business days (with a reminder after 2 business days) and no previous email about unavailability that we can go ahead. However, this could break the decision making process for OLS.
    - [MS]: The OLS decision process [can]/[has to] be in a separate scope
    - This was agreed by MS, JB, RM.
