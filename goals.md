RSE-AUNZ has four main goals:

1. Maintain an active, diverse, sustainable RSE Community.

2. Define the role of RSEs within the eResearch, Academic, and Professional context.

3. Form a connection between communities: people and organisations.

4. Obtain recognition for RSE-AUNZ and its role.

# RSE-AUNZ Strategy 2023 to 2025

The Steering Committee started reviewing the strategy and the goals of the RSE-AUNZ community in 2022. This was due to the recognition that the ability to volunteer time by the steering committee members is limited and that any committments need to be carefully considered.

You can now have a look at the Strategy document: Mosbergen, Rowland; Martinez, Paula Andrea; Poonawala, Nooriyan; Sinha, Manodeep; Stacey, Janet (2023): Research Software Engineer Australia New Zealand  Strategy 2023-2025. figshare. Online resource. [https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21385392.v1](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21385392.v1)

## Strategic Selection Criteria
Since RSE-AUNZ is a volunteer run organisation, we have to be strategic in our efforts. Lead by Rowland Mosbergen, the RSE-AUNZ Steering Committee (SC) has come up with a strategic selection criteria that is applied to all new opportunities. 

The initial set of five selection criteria are:
  - *Does this make RSEs value themselves?*
  - *Does this make Senior Managers value RSEs?*
  - *Does this grow community or raise awareness?*
  - *Does this or can this support Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI)?*
  - *Does this sit in the policy advocacy space?*

You can answer 2 - Yes, 1 - Kind of, and 0 - No. These scores then get added up. 

Policy advocacy is considered negative, so a Yes will be -2 to the total.

To take a concrete example, here is the evaluation for the RSEAA unconference in 2022:

|Selection Criteria                            | Score                   | Notes   | 
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------|
|Does this make RSEs value themselves?         | 2                       |
|Does this make Senior Managers value RSEs?    | 2                       |
|Does this grow community or raise awareness?  | 2                       |
|Does this or can this support DEI?            | 2                       | Diversity shown by working with RSE Asia and making it cheap and online 
|Does this sit in the policy advocacy space?   | 0                       |



## Deliverables
The Steering Committee is actively working on six deliverables,
